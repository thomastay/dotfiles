##GIT
In Git, HEAD refers to the current node you are in
In the shell, head refers to the command to get one line (or more, depending on your commands)
HEAD^ goes back one node
Git show shows the commit
Git diff <filename> tells you the difference between files
Types of git resets:
	--soft: The staged snapshot and working directory are not altered in any way.
	--mixed: The staged snapshot is updated to match the specified commit, but the working directory is not affected. This is the default option.
	--hard: The staged snapshot and the working directory are both updated to match the specified commit.

git revert	#undoes changes by creating a new commit
git reflog	#shows all commits, even deleted ones
git rm --cached <filename>			#Removes a file from your staging area
